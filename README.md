# Mod Features
## Post Photos, Videos, Stories, IGTVs from PC / Mac
Inssist is the only app that allows posting videos and stories to Instagram from Desktop without sharing Instagram passwords with a 3rd party app.
To post a photo, video, story or IGTV, install the plugin from Chrome WebStore and click the Plus button at the bottom of the Phone frame. Select a photo or video from your PC, enter optional caption, location, mentions and hit “Share”.
Please note some features such as GIFs, music and mentions on video stories are not yet supported by Instagram Web API and thus not available on Inssist.

## Search Relevant Hashtags
Whenever you create a new post, Inssist will automatically suggest you up to 30 relevant #hashtags to the ones you entered into the post caption. You can add suggested #hashtags to your post in one click.
Hashtag Assistant module lets you search for relevant hashtags with ease and allows building effective hashtag collections.

## Dark, Wide & Zen Modes
If you’re a fan of Dark Mode, Inssist has one of the best, custom Dark Mode implementations for Instagram. If not, you can always switch back to Light.
The same goes for Wide Screen support. Browsing the photos in a small frame may get awkward on a wide PC screen, so there is an option to fix that.
Finally, Zen mode makes your home feed look much less cluttered and more stylish. Check it out!
Multi-Account Support
Connect as many accounts as you like to Inssist and switch between them in a single click.

## Scheduling
Inssist supports scheduling posts to Instagram with advanced features such as Bulk Upload, Posting Calendar, Time Slots, Drag & Drop support, Facebook Page Cross-Posting, CSV-powered scheduling and more.
You can schedule photo, video and even carousel (multi-photo) posts with Inssist. Once scheduled, the posts will be delivered automatically. You do not need to keep the Inssist open for the posts to be delivered.

## Posting Reels & Choosing Video Covers
With Inssist PRO You can post Reels to Instagram from Desktop! You can also select video covers for your videos making a perfect Instagram profile.
